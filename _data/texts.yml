title: Black Movement-Law Project
about: 'Supporting movements for Black liberation by helping build the legal infrastructure
  necessary to protect emerging local movements.

'
about_us: "<p>After working in Ferguson, Baltimore and Cleveland, lawyers and legal
  activists have come together to create the Black Movement-Law Project. BMLP provides
  legal support to local communities throughout the country as they demonstrate against
  police brutality and systemic racism. We believe in a community centered approach
  - providing holistic legal and technical service with an understanding that mass
  defense movement legal experience is often missing from the local equation.</p><p>
  BMLP facilitates a rapid response system supporting activists during mass demonstrations
  and arrests. We work with local community groups to educate impacted communities
  in understanding their rights and responding to increased militarized police presence
  in their communities.</p><p> Our work includes legal observation and traditional
  know your rights trainings, as well as emergency infrastructure such as jail support
  mechanisms designed to meet the needs of the specific community. Further we have
  a network of national human and civil rights lawyers that assist local communities
  in urgent legal needs and long-term impact litigation.</p>\n"
